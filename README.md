# csmith's dotfiles

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine, based on
@smashwilson's [dotfiles](http://github.com/smashwilson/dotfiles).

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://llcad-github/csmith/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.bash` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## what's inside

Mine's fairly minimal - mostly just bash and git customization, with a couple
convenience scripts kept around, along with the install scripts.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.bash**: Any files ending in `.bash` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.bash**: Any file named `path.bash` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.bash**: Any file named `completion.bash` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## thanks

Thanks to [Ash Wilson](http://github.com/smashwilson) for the starting point.
